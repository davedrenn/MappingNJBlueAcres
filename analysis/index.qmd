# Analysis

Data analysis for this project was conducted using Python through Jupyter notebooks.

This project contains the following analysis: 

* Exploratory mapping - plotting the Blue Acres parcels to visualize locations
* Data visualization - mapping and graphing data based on different parameters 
* clustering using both k-means and DBSCAN
    + K-means clusters points through an algorithm that attempts to find the centroids of groups of data - the number of clusters is determined by the researcher. That centroid represents the mean value of a cluster and the data can be multidimensional based on the number of variables.
        - This method is used for NFIP data - that data was anonymized by FEMA to protect personally identifying information, and is at a simplified geography that makes it unsuitable for DBSCAN
    + DBSCAN clusters based on a point's relationship to other points - the number of clusters is determined by distance and group parameters set by the researcher
        - This method is uied for Blue Acres data to spatially cluster individual properties
